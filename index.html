	 	<p>There’s no doubt that the cost of education is on the rise. The financial concerns of earning your education should never stop you from doing so because, as Benjamin Franklin once said, this investment in yourself will pay you back with interest over your entire lifetime. Additionally, you can earn your education in a cost-effective way. Check out the University of the People’s degree programs that are all tuition-free. “Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” – Malcolm XWhile it’s safe to say that no one knows what will happen tomorrow, having an education under your belt will open the door to more opportunities. These job opportunities are also likely to pay more with more education, so what you do today in terms of education will surely prepare you for what’s yet to come.</p>
